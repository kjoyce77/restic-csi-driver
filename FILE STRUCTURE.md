Organizing the files for your CSI plugin project is crucial for maintainability and clarity, especially considering the complexity of integrating LVM, Restic, and gRPC functionalities. Here's a suggested structure that should help keep your project organized:

### Suggested File Structure

1. **`/cmd`**
   - Contains the main application entry points.
   - Example: `main.go` for the CSI plugin executable.

2. **`/internal`**
   - For internal package code (not meant to be used by external applications).
   - Subdirectories can be organized by functionality.
   
   a. **`/internal/grpc`**
      - Implementation of gRPC server and client logic.
      - Example files: `server.go`, `client.go`.

   b. **`/internal/lvm`**
      - LVM-related functionalities (like volume creation and management).
      - Example files: `volume_manager.go`, `utils.go`.
      - ** and mount **
      - ** and snapshot **

   c. **`/internal/restic`**
      - Restic backup and restore logic.
      - Example files: `backup_manager.go`, `restore_manager.go`.

   d. **`/internal/synchronization`**
      - Handle thread synchronization and pool management for backup operations.
      - Example file: `thread_pool.go`.

3. **`/pkg`**
   - For library code that's ok to use by external applications.
   - Could include utility functions, constants, etc.

4. **`/configs`**
   - Configuration files or scripts.
   - Example: `config.yaml` for defining the thin LVM pool and Restic destinations.

5. **`/scripts`**
   - Helper scripts, like build, install, or test scripts.

6. **`/tests`**
   - Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
   - Subdirectories mirroring the internal structure for clarity.

7. **`/docs`**
   - Documentation files for the project.
   - Include a `README.md`, architectural decisions, API docs, etc.

8. **`Dockerfile` and/or `Makefile`**
   - For containerization and build automation.

### Tips:
- **Consistent Naming**: Ensure file and directory names clearly reflect their purpose.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep different functionalities in separate directories (e.g., gRPC logic separate from LVM management).
- **Documentation**: Comment your code and maintain a `README.md` in each major directory explaining its contents.
- **Testing**: Allocate separate directories for tests mirroring your source structure.

This structure aims to keep your project modular and maintainable. Adjust as necessary based on your project's specific needs and scale.
